## Data Quality & Limitations

### Known Limitations

**Novogradac Pricing:**
- Sample, not census of all transactions
- May lag real-time market by 1-2 months
- Regional variations exist; national average may not reflect local pricing

**HUD LIHTC Database:**
- Annual updates create 12-month reporting lag
- Project-level data but no pricing information
- Doesn't capture 4% bond deals as completely as 9% competitive

**Construction Costs:**
- Regional variation significant; national averages may not reflect local conditions
- Tariff policies subject to rapid change
- Labor market extremely dynamic; projections uncertain

**Legislative Forecasting:**
- Political environment highly uncertain
- Bill text may change in conference or amendments
- Implementation timelines depend on agency priorities

**Stock Analysis:**
- Past performance doesn't guarantee future results
- Company fundamentals only one factor in stock performance
- Macro factors (interest rates, economy) have major impact
